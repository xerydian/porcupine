# Porcupine

Porcupine is a microtonal instrument-sequencer designed to play the Porcupine[15] scale.

Based on the Mutable Instruments Plaits synth engine.

Originally written with a QWERTY keyboard in mind, will support universal keyboard layouts.

[!NOTE]  
It's still very much a toy project in its intial stage, i just wanted an excuse to write something in Rust.

### Progress

In progress: general refactor, Universal keyboard layout support, tauri GUI, adding support for multiple voices

To do in the future: Use CPAN and add ASIO as an audio back-end, support for a timeline and patterns
